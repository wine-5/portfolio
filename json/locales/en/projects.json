    "detailedFeatures": "This game was created during a 3-day in-school game jam. As the project leader for my first game jam, managing the team was challenging.\nIt was a great learning experience coordinating with designers on the type of artwork needed and the format. With many programmers on the team, creating base classes and shortening the critical path was quite difficult.\nI was just starting to learn design patterns, so I worked hard on optimization using Singleton, ObjectPool, and other patterns.",
